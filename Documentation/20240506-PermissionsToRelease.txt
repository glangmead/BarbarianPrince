No, we DO NOT grant permission for you to digitize or reproduce The game Barbarian Prince. Even if it is for Non-Profit.

We have plans for that game.

Hi Ed,

For the past two years, I have digitized a game to replicate the Barbarian Prince. I did this as a hobby and not to make money. I have worked about 1800 hours to complete the task. I have another 200-300 hours to complete.

This was a labor of love. When finished, I was wanting to place a copy of the digital version of this game on Board Game Geeks website, but I wanted your permission. 

If you would like more details, I can provide. I need about 100-200 hours to get it to a good state for initial playtesting.  I figure 1-2 more months to get it done.

Regards,
