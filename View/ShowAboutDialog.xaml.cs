No opponent is necessary, as the Event Booklet takes you through a pre-programmed sequence of encounters which is different each time you play the game. For each event, you, as the Barbarian Prince Cal Arath, must make the decisions which will make your quest successful - or may cost you your life.\r\n\r\nAuthor: Arnold Jay Hendrick https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamedesigner/693/arnold-hendrick\r\n\r\nDwarfstar Games was a line of small-box science fiction and fantasy themed boardgames published in 1981 and 1982 by Heritage USA: https://dwarfstar.brainiac.com/ds_thanks.html.
