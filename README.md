# Barbarian Prince circa 1981

1981 Charles S. Roberts Best Fantasy Board Game Winner

Barbarian Prince is a solitaire game of heroic adventure in a forgotten age of barbarism and sorcery. No opponent is necessary, as the Event Booklet takes you through a pre-programmed sequence of encounters which is different each time you play the game. For each event, you, as the Barbarian Prince Cal Arath, must make the decisions which will make your quest successful - or may cost you your life.

Dwarfstar Games was a line of small-box science fiction and fantasy themed boardgames published in 1981 and 1982 by Heritage USA: https://dwarfstar.brainiac.com/ds_thanks.html.

Reaper Miniatures purchased the rights to several Heritage USA properties, including the Dwarfstar games. Reaper Miniatures was organized by four talented individuals who wanted to create, and be part of, a company that was both exciting and challenging. Founded in Ft Worth, Texas on July 4th 1992, Reaper Miniatures quickly established itself as a leader in pewter miniature design and production. From its inception, Reaper Miniatures has worked closely with artist, sculptors and writers to create a community of endless adventure for consumers around the world. Reaper Miniatures has graciously granted limited permission for you to download and print six of the Dwarfstar games (from the https://dwarfstar.brainiac.com/ds_thanks.html), for personal use.

NOTE: This game is a digital version of the boardgame from 1981. It replicates the original release. If any images used have license restrictions, please inform me with email (happysulla@gmail.com), and I will remove.

If a developer, I have placed design documentation in the Document folder that explains architecture. It is written in C# using WPF. If you download and compile, you will need to obtain the NuGet package: WpfAnimiatedGif per the design documentation.

CURRENT STATE: I have completed all but five events. I have all mechanics working, but I need to playtest to remove bugs. I also need to add startup tutorial, menus, store/recover, feats, and end game user displays.
